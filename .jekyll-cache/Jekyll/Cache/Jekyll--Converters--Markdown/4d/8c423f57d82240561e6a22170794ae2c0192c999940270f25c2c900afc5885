<p>The EvoCatalysis Lab is dedicated to unraveling the methods nature uses to forge efficient catalysts and applying these discoveries to revolutionize enzyme engineering, with the ultimate goal of devising cutting-edge therapeutic solutions. We leverage a multi-disciplinary toolkit comprising artificial intelligence, computational chemistry, and biochemistry assays. Our focus lies in elucidating the intricate relationships between evolution and catalysis in enzymes, from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Our work thrives on the dynamic interplay among computational scientists, life scientists, and engineers, fostering an inclusive and collaborative research environment.</p>
