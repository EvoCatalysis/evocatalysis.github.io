<p>We have established a connection between natural sequence data and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>), prompting us to introduce the concept of ‘evolutionary catalysis (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/12/nwad331/7504752">NSR, 2023</a>).’ Our research provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to pioneering in this field using both computation and experiment.</p>
