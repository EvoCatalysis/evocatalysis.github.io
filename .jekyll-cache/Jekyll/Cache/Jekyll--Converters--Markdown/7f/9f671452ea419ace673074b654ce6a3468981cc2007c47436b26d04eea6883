<p>We have used evolutionary sequence data to enhance enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Currently, our lab is heavily involved in enzyme engineering across diverse areas, such as natural product biosynthesis. Additionally, we are conducting bioinformatics analysis and genome mining to discover novel enzymes of interest.</p>
