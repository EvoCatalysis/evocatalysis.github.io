<p>We have established a connection between natural sequence data and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>), prompting us to introduce the concept of ‘evolutionary catalysis (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/12/nwad331/7504752">NSR, 2023</a>).’ Our research provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to pioneering in this field using both computation and experiment.</p>

<p>We have showcased the utilization of natural sequence data to strategically enhance various enzyme properties (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Presently, our laboratory is deeply engaged in enzyme engineering across various domains, including natural product biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Our lab is working on the development of next-generation covalent inhibitors for enzymes, particularly kinases. We aim to elevate drug selectivity by utilizing evolutionary information from enzyme homologs. We have employed QM/MM to validate this approach (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>), providing valuable insights for subsequent studies and algorithm development.</p>
