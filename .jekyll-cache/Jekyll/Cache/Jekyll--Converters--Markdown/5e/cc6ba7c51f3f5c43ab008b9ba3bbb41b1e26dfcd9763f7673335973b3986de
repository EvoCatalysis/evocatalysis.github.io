<p>We are particularly interested in using AI and computational chemistry to design drugs targeting enzymes (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>). We focus on designing drug selectivity. This requires us to use AI for molecular representation and generation, and computational chemistry for drug selectivity assesment.</p>
