We were awarded two UF ROSF grants to advance our efforts in enzyme engineering. These projects are collaborative initiatives: one with Dr. Gentry and Dr. Vander Kooi from the College of Medicine, focused on engineering therapeutic enzymes, and another with Dr. Voiniciuc from IFAS, aimed at engineering plant enzymes.
