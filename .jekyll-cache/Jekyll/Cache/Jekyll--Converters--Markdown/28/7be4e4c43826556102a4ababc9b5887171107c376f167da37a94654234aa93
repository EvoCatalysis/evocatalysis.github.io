<p>We have established a connection between evolutionary sequence data and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>) using generative AI. This prompts us to introduce the concept of ‘evolutionary catalysis (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/12/nwad331/7504752">NSR, 2023</a>).’ Our research provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to advancing this field.</p>

<p>We have leveraged naturally evolved enzyme sequences to enhance activity and stability beyond their wild-type counterparts, which have been optimized over billions of years (PNAS, 2023). Our work also demonstrated that sequence data can predict individual steps in enzymatic reactions. 
We have used enzyme sequences evolved in nature to enhance enzyme activity/stability over their wild-type which has already evolved over billions years (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>).  We also showed that sequence data can be used to predict invididual step in enzymatic reaction. Currently, our lab is heavily involved in enzyme engineering across diverse areas, such as natural product biosynthesis. Additionally, we are conducting bioinformatics analysis and genome mining to discover novel enzymes of interest.</p>

<p>Our focus lies in employing AI and computational chemistry for the purpose of designing drugs that target enzymes (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>). Specifically, we concentrate on achieving drug selectivity. This necessitates the utilization of AI for molecular representation and generation, alongside computational chemistry for assessing drug selectivity.</p>
