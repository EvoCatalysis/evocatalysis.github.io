<p>Our lab is working on the development of next-generation covalent inhibitors for enzymes, particularly kinases. We aim to elevate drug selectivity by utilizing evolutionary information from enzyme homologs. We have employed QM/MM to validate this approach (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>), providing valuable insights for subsequent studies and algorithm development.</p>
