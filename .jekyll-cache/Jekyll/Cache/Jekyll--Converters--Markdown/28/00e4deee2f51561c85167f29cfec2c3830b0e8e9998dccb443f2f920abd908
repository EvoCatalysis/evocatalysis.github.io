<p>We are particularly interested in using AI and computational chemistry to design drugs targeting enzymes. We have demonstrated how to use evolutionary information to understand the selectivity of kinase inhibitors (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>), providing valuable insights for subsequent studies and algorithm development.</p>
