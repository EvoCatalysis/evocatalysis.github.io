<h2 id="evolution-catalysis-relationship">Evolution-catalysis relationship</h2>
<p>We have established a connection between natural sequence information and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>). This insight provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. Committed to pioneering in this field, our lab aims to advance enzymology and contribute to potential therapeutic solutions involving enzymes.</p>

<h2 id="rational-enzyme-engineering">Rational enzyme engineering</h2>
<p>Our lab is dedicated to the rational design of enzymes, which requires a systematic understanding of their functioning. We have recently demonstrated in a study combining computational and experimental approaches, how we can harness natural evolutionary information to strategically improve different properties of enzymes (<a href="">under review</a>). Currently, our lab is actively developing different computational algorithms geared towards rational enzyme engineering.</p>

<h2 id="selective-covalent-drugs">Selective covalent drugs</h2>
<p>Our lab is working on the development of next-generation covalent inhibitors for enzymes, particularly kinases. We aim to elevate drug selectivity by utilizing evolutionary information from enzyme homologs. We have employed QM/MM to validate this approach (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>), providing valuable insights for subsequent studies and algorithm development.</p>
