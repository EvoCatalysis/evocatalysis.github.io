## From Sequence to Catalytic Activity
We have established a connection between evolutionary sequence data and enzyme activity/stability ([PNAS, 2022](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119)) using generative AI. This prompts us to introduce the concept of 'evolutionary catalysis ([NSR, 2023](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/12/nwad331/7504752)).' Our research provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to advancing this field.

## Rational Enzyme Engineering
We have leveraged naturally evolved enzyme sequences to enhance activity and stability beyond their wild-type counterparts, which have been optimized over billions of years ([PNAS, 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120)). Our work also demonstrated that sequence data can predict individual steps in enzymatic reactions ([JACS, 2025](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c15551)). Currently, our lab is involved in enzyme engineering across diverse areas, such as natural product biosynthesis. Additionally, we are conducting bioinformatics analysis and genome mining to discover novel enzymes of interest.

## AI-Driven Drug Discovery
Our focus lies in employing AI and computational chemistry for the purpose of designing drugs that target enzymes ([JACS, 2022](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307)). Specifically, we concentrate on achieving drug selectivity. This necessitates the utilization of AI for molecular representation and generation, alongside computational chemistry for assessing drug selectivity.
