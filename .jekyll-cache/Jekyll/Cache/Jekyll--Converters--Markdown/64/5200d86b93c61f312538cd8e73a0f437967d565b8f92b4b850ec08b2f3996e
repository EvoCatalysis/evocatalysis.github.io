<p>We have used enzyme sequences evolved in nature to enhance enzyme activity/stability over their wild-type which has already evolved over billions years (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Currently, our lab is heavily involved in enzyme engineering across diverse areas, such as natural product biosynthesis. Additionally, we are conducting bioinformatics analysis and genome mining to discover novel enzymes of interest.</p>
