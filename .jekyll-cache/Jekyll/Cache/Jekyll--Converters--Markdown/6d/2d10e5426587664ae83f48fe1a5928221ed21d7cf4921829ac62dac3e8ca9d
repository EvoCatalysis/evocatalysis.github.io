<p>We are currently offering multiple postdoctoral positions, with funding available to support either computational or experimental research/engineering in enzyme.</p>

<p><b>Biochemistry Experiment Track</b>: Applicants should exhibit research experience in areas such as protein expression purification and enzyme activity characterization. They will benefit from co-advisory with experimental PIs and will collaborate extensively with computational scientists.</p>

<p><b>Computation Track</b>: Applicants are expected to have research experience in Computational Chemistry or Computational Biology, especially in areas like Molecular Dynamics Simulations, QM/MM, or Machine Learning. However, we welcome inquiries and CV submissions from candidates with any computational background to discuss their specific circumstances.</p>

<p>Depending on project requirements, opportunities exist for joint supervision with renowened research groups, including those at Harvard University, SUNY Buffalo, etc.</p>

<p>If you are interested in our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to <a href="mailto:wenjunxie@ufl.edu">wenjunxie@ufl.edu</a>.</p>
