<h2 id="evolution-catalysis-relationship">Evolution-Catalysis Relationship</h2>
<p>We have established a connection between natural sequence data and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>), prompting us to introduce the concept of â€˜evolutionary catalysis (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/12/nwad331/7504752">NSR, 2023</a>).â€™ Our research provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to pioneering in this field using both computation and experiment.</p>

<h2 id="rational-enzyme-engineering">Rational Enzyme Engineering</h2>
<p>Our lab is dedicated to the rational design of enzymes, which requires a systematic understanding of their functioning. We have recently demonstrated in a study combining computational and experimental approaches, how we can harness natural evolutionary information to strategically improve different properties of enzymes (<a href="">under review</a>). Currently, our lab is actively developing different computational algorithms geared towards rational enzyme engineering.</p>

<h2 id="ai-driven-drug-discovery">AI-Driven Drug Discovery</h2>
<p>Our lab is working on the development of next-generation covalent inhibitors for enzymes, particularly kinases. We aim to elevate drug selectivity by utilizing evolutionary information from enzyme homologs. We have employed QM/MM to validate this approach (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>), providing valuable insights for subsequent studies and algorithm development.</p>
