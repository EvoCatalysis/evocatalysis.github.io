<p>We have showcased the utilization of natural sequence data to enhance enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Presently, our laboratory is deeply engaged in enzyme engineering across various domains, including natural product biosynthesis. Besides, we are also working on bioinformatics analysis and genome mining to identify new interesting enzymes.</p>
