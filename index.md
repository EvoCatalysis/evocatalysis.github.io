# Evolutionary Catalysis

We focus on investigating the relationship between enzyme sequences and their catalytic activities, a crucial aspect of rational enzyme engineering. We leverage a multi-disciplinary toolkit comprising AI, computational chemistry, and wet-lab. Our work thrives on the dynamic interplay among computational scientists, life scientists, and engineers, fostering an inclusive and collaborative research environment.
