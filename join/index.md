# Ongoing Opportunities


### Postdoctoral scholar
We are currently offering multiple postdoctoral positions, with funding available to support either computational or experimental research/engineering in enzyme.

<b>Biochemistry Experiment Track</b>: Applicants should exhibit research experience in areas such as protein expression purification and enzyme activity characterization. They will benefit from co-advisory with experimental PIs and will collaborate extensively with computational scientists.

<b>Computation Track</b>: Applicants are expected to have research experience in Computational Chemistry or Computational Biology, especially in areas like Molecular Dynamics Simulations, QM/MM, or Machine Learning. However, we welcome inquiries and CV submissions from candidates with any computational background to discuss their specific circumstances.

Depending on project requirements, opportunities exist for joint supervision with renowened research groups, including those at Harvard University, SUNY Buffalo, etc.

If you are interested in our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to [wenjunxie@ufl.edu](mailto:wenjunxie@ufl.edu).

### Graduate student
We accept graduate students from several different programs at University of Florida. We offer full scholarships and accept applications for both fall and spring semesters. If you are interested in our research, please reach out to [wenjunxie@ufl.edu](mailto:wenjunxie@ufl.edu). Students working in the wet-lab will receive joint supervision from the experimental group.

### Research assistant
We warmly welcome research assistants, particularly master's students from UF majoring in computer science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, and related fields.

### Undergraduate student
We have opportunities available for undergraduate research.
