    Welcome to the Xie Lab! We delve into the methods nature employs to create effective catalysts, using these insights to advance biocatalysis engineering and pave the way for innovative therapeutic solutions. The lab will open in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at University of Florida in July 2023.
