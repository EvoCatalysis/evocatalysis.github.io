<p>We have established a connection between natural sequence data and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>), which promotes us to propose ‘evolutionary catalysis’. This insight provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. Committed to pioneering in this field, our lab aims to advance enzymology and contribute to potential therapeutic solutions involving enzymes.</p>
