<p>Our focus lies in employing AI and computational chemistry for the purpose of designing drugs that target enzymes (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>). Specifically, we concentrate on achieving drug selectivity. This necessitates the utilization of AI for molecular representation and generation, alongside computational chemistry for assessing drug selectivity.</p>
