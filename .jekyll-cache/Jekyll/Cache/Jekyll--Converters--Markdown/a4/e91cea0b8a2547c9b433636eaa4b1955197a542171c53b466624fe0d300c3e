<p>Our lab is dedicated to the rational design of enzymes, which requires a systematic understanding of their functioning. Weâ€™ve recently demonstrated in a study combining computational and experimental approaches, how we can harness natural evolutionary information to strategically improve different properties of enzymes (<a href="">under review</a>). Currently, our lab is actively developing different computational algorithms geared towards rational enzyme engineering.</p>
