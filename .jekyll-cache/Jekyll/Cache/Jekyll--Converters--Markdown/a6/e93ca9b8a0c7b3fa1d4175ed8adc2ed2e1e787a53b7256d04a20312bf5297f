<p>We have leveraged naturally evolved enzyme sequences to enhance activity and stability beyond their wild-type counterparts, which have been optimized over billions of years (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Our work also demonstrated that sequence data can predict individual steps in enzymatic reactions. 
We have used enzyme sequences evolved in nature to enhance enzyme activity/stability over their wild-type which has already evolved over billions years (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>).  We also showed that sequence data can be used to predict invididual step in enzymatic reaction. Currently, our lab is heavily involved in enzyme engineering across diverse areas, such as natural product biosynthesis. Additionally, we are conducting bioinformatics analysis and genome mining to discover novel enzymes of interest.</p>
