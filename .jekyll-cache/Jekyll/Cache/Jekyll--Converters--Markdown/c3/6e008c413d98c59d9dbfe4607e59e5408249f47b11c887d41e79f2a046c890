<p>We have established a connection between natural sequence data and enzyme activity/stability (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">PNAS, 2022</a>), prompting us to introduce the concept of ‘evolutionary catalysis (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/12/nwad331/7504752">NSR, 2023</a>).’ Our research provides a fresh perspective on enzyme catalysis and evolution, marking the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to pioneering in this field using both computation and experiment.</p>

<p>We have demonstrated how to harness natural sequence data to strategically improve different properties of enzymes (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Currently, our lab is actively engineering enzymes in different topics, such as those in natural product biosynthesis.
We have showcased the utilization of natural sequence data to strategically enhance various enzyme properties (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Presently, our laboratory is deeply engaged in enzyme engineering across various domains, including natural product biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Our lab is working on the development of next-generation covalent inhibitors for enzymes, particularly kinases. We aim to elevate drug selectivity by utilizing evolutionary information from enzyme homologs. We have employed QM/MM to validate this approach (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS, 2022</a>), providing valuable insights for subsequent studies and algorithm development.</p>
