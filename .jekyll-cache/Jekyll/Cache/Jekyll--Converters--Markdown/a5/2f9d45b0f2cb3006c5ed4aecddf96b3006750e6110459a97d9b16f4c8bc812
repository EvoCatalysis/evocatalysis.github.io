<p>We have demonstrated how to harness natural sequence data to strategically improve different properties of enzymes (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312848120">PNAS, 2023</a>). Currently, our lab is actively engineering enzymes in different topics, such as those in natural product biosynthesis.
